# Pet Booking App - Frontend üêæ

### üß™ Testing

The front-end has been tested manually through user interactions such as clicks, navigation, and form submissions.  
These tests validated that the UI behaves correctly and integrates properly with the back-end API.

## Future Improvements

1. **UI & UX Enhancements**  
   Refine responsiveness, improve navigation, and add loading states and error boundaries for a smoother and more user-friendly experience across all devices.

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**  
   Restructure components and services to keep presentation, business logic, and API calls clearly separated, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

3. **Codebase Cleanup & Maintainability**  
   Apply linting rules, enforce naming conventions, reduce duplication, and create more reusable components to improve overall readability.

5. **Consistency with Back-end Improvements**
    - Handle soft deletes gracefully in the UI (e.g., canceled bookings).
    - Improve error handling and display user-friendly error messages aligned with the back-end `ErrorHandler`.
    - Avoid over-fetching user details; show only essential information.
    - Add missing CRUD operations in the UI (pets, bookings, reviews, attachments).

6. **Refresh Token Support**  
   Extend authentication with refresh tokens to maintain secure sessions without frequent re-logins when access tokens expire.

7. **Testing Strategy**  
   Introduce unit and integration tests for critical flows (authentication, bookings, payments) to ensure front-end reliability and maintainability.

8. **Improved User Feedback on Actions**  
   Provide clearer and more consistent UI feedback for user actions (e.g., success notifications, error alerts, confirmation dialogs) to enhance the overall user experience.
